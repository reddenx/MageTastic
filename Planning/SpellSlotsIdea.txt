Spell Slots and a modular spell system

a spell can have 5 destinations when cast 0-4:
0 is cast immediately and does not get stored
1-4 are stored into their slots and stored for a duration that is lengthened by each cast
1 is about 10-30 seconds and 4 is permanently stored (like a buff)

a spell has costs associated at each state in its lifecycle
spell lifecycle:

e = event
s = state

casting, acts on the caster:
-e cast start
-s casting
-e cast complete
-e cast interrupted

storage/activation, acts on the caster
-e storage start
-s storing
-e storage complete
-s stored
-e storage removal

-e activation start
-s activating
-e activation complete

effects and interactions, acts on the target or location
-e effect begin
-s effecting
-e effect end

channelling and completion, acts on the caster
-e channelling start
-s channelling
-e channelling end
-e exhaustion start
-s exhausted
-e exhaustion end

each state has a duration abd "other things?" defined by the spell, states have a tick event that spells can do things off of, example: a healing aura buff every 500 ticks or maybe synched with time, heals units within 5 meters of the target
each event can have actions defined by the spell that act on the target

* if there's begin and end events, maybe the state only exists as data and duration, with no attached data?

spell slot interaction mechanics: recharge % is added before applying, possibly moving a character into the (-). when a negative recharge happens, all spell slots are purged and you become exhausted (half speed) for 3 seconds. 

example:
healing aura buff with emergency finish,
description: costs 10 energy to start and can't move while casting; while in a slot, heals 3hp to allies within 3 meters every second, reserves 10 energy and reduces recharge by 20%; when expended from the slot, heals 20hp to allies in 8 meter range and reduces their damage by 20% for 8 seconds.
input: cast "constant healing buff" into slot 4
-e cast start, deduct 10 energy or fail, reduce speed by 50%, reduce energy recharge to 0
-s casting 8 second duration
-e cast complete, remove spell adjustments

-e storage start (4), reduce speed by 100%
-s storing, 1 second
-e storage complete, remove deductions, reserve 10 energy, reduce energy recharge by 20%
-s stored, every 1 second, target aura 3 meters to frendly entities, use effect A
-e storage removal, remove spell adjustments

-e activation start, reduce speed by 100%, target aura 8 meters to friendly entities, use effect B
-s activating, 1 second
-e activation end, remove spell adjustments

effect A
-e effect begin, add current 3hp
-s effecting, 0 seconds
-e effect end, n/a

effect B
-e effect begin, add curent 20hp, speed increased by 50%, damage reduced by 20%
-s effecting, 8 seconds
-e effect end, remove spell adjustments
