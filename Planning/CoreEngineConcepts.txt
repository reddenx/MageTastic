Physics: Centralized engine, all objects go in, collisions handled, clean world comes out.  This is the last step of the update loop.

Objects: EVERYTHING is an object, character+weapons is an object, projectiles, aoe pools etc, all objects.  non component structure, inheritance and specialization for AOE, projectiles, characters, decorations, particles.  characters specialize as playercontrolled, and ai.  

Object State: FSM, implemented using state pattern, hopefully won't be changing
